Definitions: 

            "Const": A variable that is const means the value is immutable or can't be changed when reassignment.   

            "Document": A Document object represents the HTML document that is displayed in that window.
                        The Document object hav various properties that refer to other objects which allow  access
                        to and modification of document content."

            "getElementById": Returns an Element (from html) object representing the element whose id property
                            matches the specified string. 

            "querySelector": returns the first Element within the document that matches the specified selector,
                            or group of selectors. If no matches are found, null is returned.


Thoughts: 
            - (Question About querySelector):   What if you don't want to return the first Element with the same class 
                                                but want to return the second Element with the same class instead?
                                                Answer: 
                                                
                                                - "QuerySelectorAll(): If you need a list of all elements matching the specified selector".
                                                -  Maybe a proper structure of the HTML/CSS file is very important.
